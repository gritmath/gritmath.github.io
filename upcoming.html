    As far as upcoming releases go, Nintendo has a lot planned for the 2015 holiday season and Q1 2016. Nintendo has recently announced very anticipated titles during E3 2015. A long, long awated sequel to Star Fox, a game that has not seen an original sequel since 2006 with the poor selling Star Fox Command. Star Fox Zero is scheduled to release for Wii U on November 20, 2016.

    <p>On the subject of more E3 announcement titles, Xenoblade Chronicles released on June 10 of 2010 and was very quickly hailed as one of the best RPGs (Role Playing Games) of all time. During E3 of 2015 Nintendo announced Xenoblade Chronicles X, which was promised to have better everything. Graphics, gameplay, story, music, as far as what Nintendo has promised the game is supposed to be a direct buff from the original Xenoblade. Xenoblade Chronicles X is scheduled to release for Wii U on December 4, 2015.

    <p>Moving over to 3DS we have a slew of titles coming in the holiday season. Yo-Kai Watch is big in Japan. Actually it's huge. This game series has spawned an anime and countless licensed toys and products that you can find in just about any store over there. Like Pokemon, the game has you summon creatures to do your fighting for you. Called yokai, these cohorts are basically ghosts that you collect as you play. Will this game sweep the West as it did the East? We'll have to wait until November 6, 2015 to find out. Next up on the 3DS wait list we have Pokemon: Super Mystery Dungeon. This isn't your average Pokemon game. Instead of running around, catching the adorable monsters and having them fight each other, you guide them into randomly-generated dungeons, where they'll fight enemies and try to avoid traps. The game contains all 720 Pokemon ever released, so don't go thinking it's light on content. You can explore the dungeons yourself when this game drops on November 20, 2015. 

    <p>We move into 2016 now, with Mario and Luigi: Paper Jam. Over the years, the Mario and Luigi series has been home to some of the funniest, most original role-playing games around, thanks to their oddball stories and timing-based combat. This upcoming installment mashes the 2D world of Paper Mario into the mix, which promises to produce even more chaotic fun than usual. And lastly on our 3DS lineup we have one of the most long awaited sequels in handheld gaming history. The world renowned Fire Emblem: Awakening shocked the world with its amazing story and its fun and strategic gameplay. Now, we bring in Fire Emblem: Fates. The game will feature the series trademark turn-based strategy gameplay, and will focus on player choice. That's all we know so far, but if it's as good as Awakening, fans are in for a treat.

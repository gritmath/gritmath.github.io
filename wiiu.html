    The Wii U is a home video game console created by Nintendo and the successor to the Wii. The system was released in November 2012. As the first entry in the eighth generation of video game home consoles, it competes with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One.

    <p>The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support high-definition graphics. The system's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad, which features an embedded touchscreen. The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display (either providing an alternate, asymmetric gameplay experience, or a means of local multiplayer without resorting to a split screen), or in supported games, to play the game directly on the GamePad independently of the television. Games can support any combination of the GamePad, Wii Remote, Nunchuk, Balance Board, or Nintendo's more traditionally designed Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller for input. The Wii U is backwards compatible with most games released for the Wii. Online functionality on the Wii U centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse, an integrated social networking service which allows users to share content in game-specific communities.

    <p>The Wii U has faced mixed critical reception; while praising its GamePad controller (albeit panning it for its short battery life), improvements to its online functionality over the original Wii, its level of backwards compatibility with existing Wii software and controllers, its affordability in comparison to other eighth-generation consoles, and not requiring a subscription for online functionality, critics noted issues with certain aspects of the console's user interface and functionality, along with a weak lineup of launch titles and a lack of clear vision. The console was met with slow consumer adoption, credited primarily to an initially weak lineup of games, along with its lower specifications in comparison to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

    <p>Adoption of the Wii U began to improve in 2013 following the release of several prominent first-party titles for the system, including The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD, Mario Kart 8, which is currently the best-selling Wii U title worldwide, with over 5.43 million copies sold, and my own personal favorite, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, which Nintendo claimed was the "fastest-selling" Wii U title, selling 490,000 copies in the United States in its first three days of availability. The Wii U also supports indie (independant) and third party game development, sporting a wide variety of indie and third party titles, some of the best indie games being Shovel Knight and The Binding of Isaac Rebirth. As for third party, the best and most popular are Bayonetta 2 and The Wonderful 101.
